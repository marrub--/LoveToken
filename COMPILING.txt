Compiling LoveToken is near trivial since it only needs C99 (and optionally iconv).
Build an object file from lt.c (and link it with iconv if you want conversion) into a dll/so/etc.
You can compile with the NO_ICONV definition to skip iconv requirements.

Also, compiling with GDCC ( http://github.com/DavidPH/GDCC ) is now allowed.
It will automatically omit iconv and use some specialized functions to work.
