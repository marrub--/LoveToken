Compiling LoveToken is trivial since it only needs C99, and optionally iconv.
You can compile with the LT_NO_ICONV definition to disable iconv.

Compile lt.c to an object file and statically or dynamically link it with
your application. That's it. Don't forget to include lt.h.

If you don't want to export it to a DLL/SO/whatever, define LT_NO_EXPORT.

Also, compiling with GDCC ( http://github.com/DavidPH/GDCC ) works.
It will automatically omit iconv and use some specialized functions to work.
